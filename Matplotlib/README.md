## Creating and Customizing Our First Plot

Learn the basics of creating and customizing your first plot with Matplotlib. This section covers the essential components of a plot including titles, labels, and legends.

## Bar Charts and Analyzing Data from CSV Files

This section demonstrates how to create bar charts and analyze data imported from CSV files. Bar charts are useful for comparing categorical data.

## Pie Charts

Explore how to create pie charts to represent data in a circular format. Pie charts are ideal for showing proportions of a whole.

## Stack Plots

Stack plots are used to show the distribution of data over time. This section covers how to create and customize stack plots.

## Filling Areas on Line Plots

Learn how to fill areas on line plots to emphasize regions of interest. This technique is useful for highlighting specific parts of the data.

## Histograms

Histograms are great for plotting the distribution of data. This section covers how to create and interpret histograms.

## Scatter Plots

Scatter plots are used to represent the relationship between two variables. This section demonstrates how to create and customize scatter plots.

## Plotting Time Series Data

Time series data is data collected over time. This section covers techniques for plotting and analyzing time series data.

## Plotting Live Data in Real-Time

Learn how to plot live data in real-time. This is useful for applications that require real-time data visualization.

## Subplots

Subplots allow you to create multiple plots in a single figure. This section covers how to create and customize subplots in Matplotlib.
